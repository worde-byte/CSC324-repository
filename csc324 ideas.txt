1. Covid data, has daily cases in each country divided by covid variant

2. Will investigate covid cases of each variant across the world and potentially time

3. Put on map of world/US states/regions of world (if world, 195 countries would likely be too much data to visualize simultaneously, may do by continent or some other form of region)

Put a bubble on each country which relates to how many covid cases it has, may consider data per capita

Make the bubbles change size over time depending on the number of covid cases (potentially a 7 day rolling average)

Color the bubbles based on either variant of covid or recoveries and deaths

4. Understanding trends across the world would be useful for directing research and working to prevent future pandemics
